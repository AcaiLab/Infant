# Infant Facial Emotion Recognition and Cross-Domain Adaptation

*Code and experiments for evaluating deep learning models on infant facial expressions.*

### The project focuses on:
	- Evaluating CNNs (VGG-16, ResNet-18) and Vision Transformers (ViT-B/16, APViT, HLA-ViT)
	- Classifying four infant facial expression categories: angry, cry, laugh, normal
	- Measuring cross-domain generalization from adult → infant expressions
	- Applying Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to reduce developmental domain gaps
	

The code establishes baseline performance and provides tools to investigate representational differences between age groups.

### Requirements
	- Python 3.9+
	- PyTorch ≥ 2.0
	- timm
	- torchvision
	- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
	- scikit-learn

### Citation

A formal citation entry will be added upon publication.
